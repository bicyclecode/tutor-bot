I hope that you are all enjoying the term break… as well as getting plenty of work done.

***

Attached is some information regarding the first day back from Easter (Monday 24th). It is a timetable for the Monday and for some of you Tuesday research presentations.

The research presentations will be conducted as seminars and feedback will be done within the group. It is essential that you prepare a research presentation that clearly and concisely demonstrates the work you have been doing over the past few weeks as well as denoting the trajectory of the project (what you are going to do next).

You are all working on very different projects and so it is up to you to think about how to deliver this - you might have maps, models, films, audio, prototypes, images and so on. Please bring all work you have produced. 

Please don’t simply talk through a sketchbook or a series of notes - please take the time to refine what you are presenting.

Hello Y1,

For those who are still waiting to have your briefs signed off I will be in the studio from 10am. Please come with your brief outlines and titles.

There will be a signup list and we will work in that order. 
If you are struggling or waiting please make sure that you are showing it to other students and making sure that you are communicating your aims and territories for the work.

For those who have already had their brief signed off could you please make sure it is uploaded to the VLE.

Real best,

Stuart

is a design 'journal of sorts', a place where the signs describing and constructing reality get analysed, manipulated, compressed and collided to generate new forms and directions."

Thanks to all those who presented today! Some fantastic presentations!
We are all really looking forward to tomorrow.
In terms of self reflection for this project if you could complete the same two questions as last time.

If you could also prepare a supporting document of all research conducted during this project. This could be an online or physical thing.

Questions:

1. What have you learnt during this project?

2. If you were given two more weeks to work on this project what would you do?

Your answers should be written as a group.
Please send this and any other links etc. to s.bannocks@gold.ac.uk
Submitted by the end of Friday.

Real best,

Stuart
Hello Y1

I have done my absolute best to incorporate all your requests. This is as accurate as possible to that. This is the final draft.

Three things:

1. Please let us know specifically where you would like us to meet you - some of you might have very particular routes, directions or performative elements that you wish to choreograph. Please email me this information today. Preferably in a google maps url.

2. Please email along with the above a contact phone number incase of delays etc. 

3. You are more than welcome to join us on our trip around stratford. It is always interesting and worthwhile to see your colleagues work.

We are all very much looking forward to seeing what you produce!

Real best,

Stuart
Hello Y1,

Just a quick reminder that there will be drop in tutorial sessions tomorrow in the studio with Liam & Patrick.

There is no fixed timetable for these. I would strongly recommend that you use these to refine and push your ideas/making this week.

Real best,

Stuart
We've talked about these guys in the past -- they're talking tomorrow night as part of the fine art lecture series:
Go, be critical and ask good questions!
Thank you for a great day of models and presentations. Some really excellent investigation and presentations. Very much looking forward to seeing what you do next!
Please make sure you are keeping your own record of your work. This will be essential for future ref etc. So take the time to photograph and document your models, components of work and process.
We are now working toward your interventions - please remember to really utilise all your group and start to prototype and test potential interventions etc. Get into the workshop - ask questions and start making!

Please bring all work to tutorials on Friday. Please see this as another opportunity to present all work and ideas so please prep accordingly (photos, films, objects models etc.)

Note: If you have a specific time or day specification for your presentation next week please let us know on Friday.

Have a good week!

Real best,

Stuart

It's been an intensive week, but make the most of reading week to reflect on all the sessions and to further research your topic. Think about how content from the sessions may support or develop your topic. 
I've heard lots of really interesting ideas and perspectives being discussed as topics which is great. Keep in mind that the word
so give yourselves some limits to what you want to discuss/convey in the zine. 
Please be aware that there will be separate register taken for this afternoon's Lecture. Those of you who already signed for the afternoon session this morning will not be counted. 
I have received notification that attendance at yesterday’s ecology and design lecture/series was poor.

It is essential that you attend all timetabled studies and that you are on time. Strolling in 10 minutes after the session has begun is unacceptable and disrespectful to your fellow students and to the staff running the session. 

For those of you who did miss this without notifying the design office with valid mitigating circumstances, or prior existing mitigation you will receive a warning letter.

Please attend all further sessions.
We will be enjoying breakfast from 10am, this will form the basis of the session so please bring something to eat, drink and share. It could be bread, jam, fruit, pancakes, teabags or anything else, either bought or made yourself.
 We will provide kettles, toasters, cups, plates, cutlery and even napkins.
Your intervention is routed in a series of parallel experiences, perspectives and layers of reference, as such it is incredibly complex and ultimately confusing (in a good way?). Much of this you are in total control of and you did extremely well in cajoling us into the designated roles you had assigned for us. This was really well crafted, from the lanyards to the specific instructions that you relayed in person in relative isolation on the short walk to the film location. As such when we came together to discuss our own experiences they were very different and hence the confusion and interest in that confusion arose. The parallel of the film set was as such really well placed, creating hierarchies of experiences and participation in the production. 
What this work produces as a whole is still somewhat a mystery to many of us, and the crafting of that story, of the rationale for our activities in that space needed some clarity in a way - the film becomes a rouse for the activity and the commotion created around this piece of architecture, its history, meaning and intention as a monument to canceled or failed futures. 
There is a question as to whether or not the film needs to be made, much like the office that disappears the day after the scam having seemingly being established and permanent, the dis-orienting effect of your film production creates an excitement that would have drawn attention to the object: what just happened here?! 
The particulates, the discrete objects here are fantastic in their own right, from the cake as a tribute or ritual eating of the space to the cape that extended the intended bridge off into the horizon. 
Your model presentation was excellent and you really managed to construct a visually as well as experientially interesting and engaging space. It worked extremely well as a vehicle to house and convey your observation in the space and the site for intervention. 
Ryan Gander’s retelling of Goldfinger’s Trellick tower from the perspective of a child is a nice one to look at 
In project 1.5, you are asked to consider your learning from the previous 4 projects and write your own project brief, allowing you to engage with a topic of your own interest. 
In project 1.1, +1 we visited the V&A collection in Kensington to research and respond to the collection. You were asked to select an existing grouping of objects and design into it. We asked you to design something that was appropriate and sensible to its context (the original collection) as well as being progressive and relevant to your own interests and interpretations - updating, growing, diversifying or subverting the collection. This was not simply an exercise in pure reproduction or copying, this was about designing an object that belongs within your understanding and de nition of a chosen collection - it was up to you having formulated this de nition to generate an informed and convincing rationale for what you added, what it does and why it belongs there. 
In project 1.2, Entangled Things you explored the complexities of things by looking at the worlds they/we inhabit and how new interpretations of these worlds in turn allow us to reinterpret and invent new things. You were also asked to work in groups to design maps and tools to understand an object and its entanglement with the world. You were then asked to design something that does one of the following: Transform, Extend, Uncover or Reinvent the original thing in response to your explorations. 
In project 1.3, For The Love Of we focused on human behavior. We concentrated on people’s loves and obsessions.The project focused on Research. We wanted youto continue to understand that research is not just collating and synthesizing information from the Internet and pasting it into a project (Secondary research). Research manifests itself in numerous forms and whenever possible, it is the creation of new knowledge. Research is not just gathered up, it is produced by asking appropriate and interesting questions to others, by experimenting with places, spaces and things, while also recording your observations and actions (Primary research). 
In project 1.4, The Environment Keeps Happening To Me you were asked to take an active role in a system and to either develop, appropriate or subvert it. You were asked to be -- “Architects of your sel sh and or social desire.” You were also asked to use the term ‘architecture’ as a vehicle to confront a range of contexts, schemes and scales of activity. 
2017 While the rst 3 projects allow a focus on a single user (you/other) or object, project 1.4 (a bridging project to year 2) asked you to consider a larger and possibly more complex reading of design where subjects, objects and spaces contribute to our understanding and development of culture. 
As with all of the projects the format is very simple. We have provided a template with 2 sections for you to complete, A Title and a Project Description. 
You must write a Project Title rather like an author writes a title for a book or an artist writes a title for a piece of their work. You will probably start by writing the project description/topic/context and once you have established this you will probably think of a title. 
You must write a short (Approximately 250 words) Project description that outlines the topic or context for the project. This might be something you have become interested in or something you have been waiting to work on for some time. It might be developed from an issue or observation noted down in one of your diaries/notebooks or from some research relating to some aspect of one of the previous projects. 
Throughout the year Studio Practice has been formatively assessed through a series of presentations and crits. The formative assessment has allowed you to re ect on your progress and make improvements as you go along. Your nal mark for this course will be awarded from the assessment of the nal project 1.5 where you will have the opportunity to respond to the formative feedback from throughout the year. 
The nal summative assessment will occur without you present. 
Title 
*********** 
Project Description (Approximately 250 Words) 
       *********************************
Duration 2017 
This project is launched during the nal week of term 2. You will be expected to work on this project over the Easter break. Students on other courses will be revising for exams in the summer term. You will have the advantage of being able to produce a body of work in your own time that will contribute to your nal mark. There will be 56 days (8 Weeks) from start to the nish for this project. We do expect you to have a short break but given the duration we will be expecting an improvement in the quality and quantity of the work. 
Presentation 
The project will be presented through exhibition only. All work produced should be displayed in your studio space at the submission deadline ** Friday 12th May 2017 at 4pm ** The presentation should be considered as a stand-alone presentation without any verbal explanation. In other words, not simply left on your desk but thoughtfully presented. 
Important: When designing your presentation, please refer to the BA Design marking criteria and ensure that you give a comprehensive, coherent account of your project. 
Please arrange any necessary equipment (computer, projector, TV etc.) in advance, and ensure that your presentation works smoothly. Anyone presenting using such equipment is advised to arrive early to set up, and return at 5.00pm to remove equipment. Or alternatively, discuss your presentation with tutors. 
Deliverables 
Your presentation should include. The Project Brief - Your typed project brief with your name and Project title. Your sketchbook - This should contain your research and design development for this project. This document should show research in the broadest terms, photography from di erent sources and including your own, referenced web images, observational drawings, theoretical papers/web links etc. etc. Sketches (that develop the research), design drawings and or sketches that develop your ideas towards the nal outcome. 
Your nal design, design intervention, Object, Image, Drawing, Film, etc. etc. including models, prototypes images, sketches etc. 
A 300-word (max) statement (not the brief) - This document should explain your project outcome and nal design and would also include your name and project title. 
2017 Self Evaluation 
Towards the project deadline you should complete a self-evaluation document, which is designed to help you re ect on your project work against the various marking criteria. The emphasis here is on a critical evaluation of your performance, to include perceived strengths and weaknesses in each category. Self-evaluation forms should be left in your space. Please leave the self- evaluation form with your work. Please note: this is an examination – there will be no extensions. 
Assessment and Feedback 
There are points within the project schedule at which information will be presented with verbal feedback, it is your responsibility to listen to the comments of sta (and students) and record them. Your overall project work will be assessed at the presentation exhibition. Following the exhibition you will receive an assessment document from the project sta . This document will indicate the level of your work against the marking criteria, and will give you an overall sense of your performance for this project. 
Assessment Evidence Base (marking criteria) All projects during Year 1 are marked using the following criteria, full details of which are available in the student handbook: Concept Formulation; Project Identi cation; Process; Research; Outcome; Presentation; Project Management (see Student Handbook or Self Evaluation form for details). 
Learning Outcomes 
At the end of this project students should demonstrate: 1. An awareness of their potential as a designer; beginning to understand and question how and why they wish to design; 2. The capacity to look at design and designing in relation to the imperatives of a user and to understand that what delineates design is use, in the broadest terms; 3. The development of practical skills and an awareness of various techniques and methods to model, represent and produce their ideas in 2D, 3D and text. Use e ectively and safely a range of tools and equipment; 4. An understanding of how design (object, image, text and system) signi es and carries values; 5. An awareness of theory, and an attempt to engage with its relevance to their practice, both as a starting point to design and as a discursive net to support and critique their designs 
********************************** Entangled Things ********************************** 
Introduction ********************************** Understanding the world of things is not a simple task, and as designers you will need to develop your skills of critically engaging and exploring the complex networks, relationships, practices, and actions that constitute things. We are deeply connected to the things that surround us, they augment our existence, and are integral to our everyday lives. It could be argued that we make things and in turn these things shape us. Our entanglement with things also extends to the living, we objectify animals giving them different names in the UK when they are alive and dead, as in pig and pork, and cow and beef, going back in history when meat was owned by the ruling french occupiers as tax. Christien Meindertsma has spent three years researching all the products made from a single pig in her book Pig 05049, which illustrates the extent of entanglement we have with them. The Anthropologist Tim Ingold talks about how objects are moments in the ow of material culture, where practices and imagination become manifest as things. This is an insightful reading of design as ux. They are collections of interconnected ows of changing matter, cultural practices converging as a singular thing, a thing that becomes an attractor or archetype. The analogy here is ‘words’ as objects in language, as words hold a collective meaning that changes over time. This brings into focus the parallel the connection between language and action with things and practices. If we think about things in these terms, then we have to address the object as an ongoing enacted performance between people and things. In this project we must consider how things allow us to act in the world, but they are often so deeply connected to us that they can go unnoticed. 
Interference ********************************** There is an interesting analysis of the interference of things on us, some things extend our interaction in the world, whilst others ef ciency reduce it. These have been described in terms of compression and donation by the architect Robin Evans in his book Translation from drawing to building. A compressive relationship is one that reduced our interaction with the world through ef ciency, like a washing machine or a GPS, but at the same time they diminishes our physical interactions with the world, as we don’t need to know the feeling of scrubbing clean fabric, or remembering our way through the city. On the other side is the donative object, one which extends and enriches our interactions with our physical experiences, like a musical instrument or a DSLR 
camera, as we have to develop a practice to become experts in their use. As the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus proposes that we can only truly understand a thing through the practice of using it ‘being in the world’, it discloses the world to us as we develop our skills to use it, and hence the the possibilities of our world change because we can use it. 
Being in the World ********************************** Skill in action-practice We are also interested in the connection between objects and mastery, look at the work of Hubert Dreyfus. Skillful enactment with things. As we have discussed that things also are the manifestation of cultural practices and actions. If we want to protest we could carry and broadcast the words of our protest with objects like placards or we could make yers, or perhaps even drop them from a ballon. The point we are making is to think about things differently. We need to unpack, discover, explore and play with these complex networks of entanglement. In this project we will be exploring the complexities of things by looking at the worlds we inhabit through the lens of the thing. This includes objects that mediate; identity, cultural practices, expertise, knowledge, power, connection, care, fear, and so on. We will fracture the chosen set of objects, and investigate them using a mapping tool that sets up an approach to questions the object in a number of ways.

2016 
Project Phases ********************************** 
Phase 1 Research Tuesday 15th NOV 10am - Friday 18th 
Starting in the studios for a brie ng on mapping your objects entanglement. Phase 1 will be done in groups of apx six. Each group will be given an object and will build a map of its entanglement. This map will be how your research is submitted Friday in the studio. 
You are required to produce a map of your research an study. This map could take many forms and can include a variety of mediums - it should be inclusive of all your studies. 
Phase 2 Designing Monday 21st NOV- Friday 2nd DEC 
You will now be using your entanglement maps to design individually. Not in groups! You will design 1 object each. This will be a new design of your object that considers the network of its entanglement. Re- address the object, think and develop how it could reveal, expose, extend, react, repurpose, transform, or question that network of entanglement through your design. 
Ideation performance workshop:

Phase3 Final Presentation 
Friday 2ND DEC In your Team you will now have 6 new designs ‘the Collection’ you have designed one thing each. We would like you to make a group presentation as a performance to show your network of your entangled thing, and the collection of things you have now individually made. It must be a single presentation not 6 seperate ones! 
Final Presentation ********************************** 
Friday 2ND DEC 2016 The work will be presented as a 10 minute performance. St James Stuido (Annexe) 
GROUPS A-B 10am - 1pm GROUPS C-D 2pm - 5pm 
Learning Outcomes ********************************** 
This project should enable students to: *Entangle theory and practice. *Examine further ways in which designs signify and carry values. *Explore appropriate and varied ways of looking and recording, manipulating materials and representing thoughts. *Extend existing skills and begin to develop new ones, utilizing techniques and processes being introduced through other aspects of the Programme. 
She said, ‘what is “historicity”?’ ‘When a thing has history in it. Listen. One of those two Zippo lighters was in Franklin D. Roosevelt’s pocket when he was assassinated. And one wasn’t. One has historicity, a hell of a lot of it. As much as any object ever had. And one has nothing .... You can’t tell which is which. ere’s no “mystical plasmic presence”, no “aura” around it.

In this brief you will annex a collection +1 
You will select an existing grouping of objects* and design into it. e object* you design should be appropriate and sensible to its context (the original collection) as well being progressive and relevant to your own interests 
and interpretations - updating, growing, diversifying or subverting the collection. 
*object here is used as shorthand for any number of artefacts in any number of mediums. 
Week 1 
PART 1: Research & Analysis 
Monday 17th: Brief launch - A Visit to the V&A Museum 
You will select and study a collection/ cabinet within the V&A Museum. is study will formulate the parameters for what you will design as an addition to your chosen collection. 
You will produce: notes, sketches, drawings and other documentation. You are asked in your study to consider and re ect upon: material, form, meaning, purpose, context, history, narrative etc. 
PLEASE NOTE: this is not an exercise in pure reproduction or copying, this is about designing an object that belongs within your understanding and de nition of a chosen collection - it is up to you having formulated this de nition to generate an informed and convincing rationale for what you will add, what it does and why it belongs.

THE
ENVIRONMENT
KEEPS
HAPPENING
TO
ME
“In this moment, a now of ever growing ‘corporate
personhood’, where nations, cities, demographics,
organisations, collectives, businesses, websites,
services, shops, homes, and objects are
cut ‘n’ paste, finely sliced legal landscapes,
the ability to confidently discern between the
public and private realm becomes illusive.
Every day we traverse a patch-worked collage,
a bric-a-brac of situations unique in their
uniformity. Situations defined by systems,
unspoken contracts,‘safe-walks’, expectations,
responsibilities and limitations. We are funnelled
into lanes, alleys, actions, roles and thoughts.
The environment keeps happening to you.
The environment keeps happening to me.”
-- JL & SB
In this brief you will take an active role in
a system.
The system you address might be something you
develop, appropriate or subvert.
You will be -- “Architects of your selfish and or
social desire.”
Throughout this project we will use the term
‘architecture’ as a vehicle to confront a range of
contexts, schemes and scales of activity.
This project is broken into two stages and you will
directly address two different scales which relate
to two discrete deliverables:
Stage 1 – 1:25 ❏ (Re)search, model & proposal. 
Stage 2 – 1:1 ❏ Intervention. 
Stage 1: (Re)search & model
Your group will be given a specific location in
which to begin your study. Within that location
you are asked to observe and analyse: individuals,
‘THE OTHER’, crowds, groups, systems, behaviours,
privacy, exposure, politics, actions, movements,
modes, limits, paths, components, rules,
guides, directions, designs, demands, requests,
orientation, disorientation . . . and so on and on.
Consider the potential methods by which you can
conduct a study of your location.
Be experimental. Be critical.
NOTE:
Conduct yourself considerately in relation to the
general public and others around you.
Be aware and adhere to legalities. STAY SAFE!
DELIVERABLE 1
You have been given an architectural figure:
it is 1:25.
❏ Build a 1:25 model of the *behaviour* that you have observed and wish to address. This model will support an architectural narrative that you will present as a group. 
This narrative might well utilise other supporting
forms of research material, such as sketches,
other models, images, film etc. but the model is
the primary vehicle for delivering any
research findings.
The model might be literal containing accurate
topological data (buildings, street furniture,
found objects etc.) or it might be an abstraction,
or a combination of the two.
The model is to be understood as two things:
❏A summation and presentation of researched information. 
❏A proposal for an intervention, outlining your intentions. 
Stage 2: Architectural Intervention
Design and contrive your proposed intervention.
YOU ARE ASKED TO CONSIDER AND FRAME YOUR
INTERVENTION WITHIN THESE PARAMETERS:
Notes on our feedback tutorial: 
Be wary of the contextless comment. Finding where your objects live becomes really important in terms of pushing your practice further - it's a case of elevating the outcome but also considering the context in the development of the work. 
These critical or comment oriented objects can have a lot of merit but they need to be pinned down to the same rigour as other design objects - a use, an audience etc. 
You have a series of strong 'outcomes' or directions within this project and they work together to build an essay of engagement with the topic of apologies. As we deal with increasingly more complex topics within our projects the idea of a single outcome can become redundant. Embrace this. Ask what unifies the things you have created etc. The Jersey cabbage bread is a lovely vehicle for your inheritance ritual and it subtly references the original collection in a way that isn’t too obvious (I’m happy the ‘born with a silver spoon’ reference isn’t front and centre). 
The justification text is very balanced in terms of its reference to both the Jersey tax haven (it’s not too descriptive) and your objects narrative. 
The project was managed very well as you didn’t spend too much time casting or making the object, which meant you were able to craft and refine the narrative. 
Your process has been founded on drawing and making (paper prototypes, models etc.) and this is reflected in an outcome that is considered in both its concept and materiality - this was a result of an iterative process that involved you designing, iterating, reflecting. Keep this up! Remember in future projects to always be rigorous in your research of a chosen context, as it will present opportunities for design - such as the jersey cabbage bread, david cameron’s tax haven building etc. 
This is the beginning of great project. Photograph it properly. Maybe make a film of the process? This object was generated through deriving an artefact from a context (jersey bread), designing an object in response to it (your object), and the next step you need to think about is how you would re-contextualise this object i.e consider where this cabbage leaf would go when it’s not involved in the bread making process - is it on the wall, above the fireplace, who’s fireplace? 
Great work - keep going, keep making & keep producing!

The notion of an
archive is fascinating, and something Id love to see develop in more
detail. Unfortunately, it felt quite surface, as a celebration – it’s not a funeral it’s something else, something
to be designed, for you to design!
The object you made needs a higher resolution – if it’s an archive, it needs to be an archive – how are
photographs preserved? How are paints kept, etc etc. There is a lots of detail here that you could get into a
develop. What are the material processes you can develop here that are specific to the project? How do
you handle the archiving of materials /// The geology of ford-ite /// Memorial /// Birthplace of cultural byproducts.

As a group your research was excellent, and put you all in a good position to develop the project.
Your presentation was good in some ways but left me very confused. It was never really explained or made
obvious otherwise what the oil bottle was supposed to be doing? Your explanation of creating a byproduct
could have been really significant but it was lost on us. Throughout the presentation you almost
performed as a group, but it never really managed to get past students showing student work. I think some
more prep and communication between you all was needed here.

The concept and project identification are spelled out very well in your 100 word statement. The tie is such a
ubiquitous garment, and is able to carry many meanings and codes within it. Your process and research was great, and
I loved your experiments with different ties.
Identifying particular people to base the ties on is good, and gives you something specific to work around. These
people, heroes or villains, give us an example of practices or behaviours that have become emblematic of financial
culture today. The statements are important so I wonder if (as they come from you) you are in danger of making
assumptions about what they may think, and rather, it may be more compelling to work with real “quotes”, statements
or messages from bankers themselves, and that may add an extra depth and authenticity to the project. More research,
such as interviews with these subjects, may have given you real understanding of their experience.
The collection is well displayed, on the velvet cushion which is emblematic of a luxury Saville row shirtmakers, and
it’s great to see you’ve used the workshop.
I’d encourage you to take this project further by designing a complete tie – pattern included, and see if you can produce
this via the embroidery machine. The ties look like they could go two directions. First they could become a means of
protest, that inspire connections between like minded people through words or codes or symbols. Or they could tell a
story, moral tale of the legends of the industry – successful or tragic. In either case it would be interesting to construct
your own pattern, complete with icons, colours and text, thereby designing your own rich symbolic narrative language. The BA Design is a practice-led programme that both integrates and challenges specialisms and their boundaries.  Making is at the heart of what we do - we make ideas, concepts, prototypes, services, experiences, objects, communities - and, in this, we aim to better the world.  We are speculative and realistic in our approach; we teach you to imagine futures and fictionalise the world to speculate on the 'what if...' And we negotiate with the realities of our past and contemporary existence to intervene in the here and now.The BA Design is a practice-led programme that both integrates and challenges specialisms and their boundaries.

***

Attached is some information regarding the first day back from Easter (Monday 24th). It is a timetable for the Monday and for some of you Tuesday research presentations.

The research presentations will be conducted as seminars and feedback will be done within the group. It is essential that you prepare a research presentation that clearly and concisely demonstrates the work you have been doing over the past few weeks as well as denoting the trajectory of the project (what you are going to do next).

You are all working on very different projects and so it is up to you to think about how to deliver this - you might have maps, models, films, audio, prototypes, images and so on. Please bring all work you have produced. 

Please don’t simply talk through a sketchbook or a series of notes - please take the time to refine what you are presenting.

is a design 'journal of sorts', a place where the signs describing and constructing reality get analysed, manipulated, compressed and collided to generate new forms and directions."

Thanks to all those who presented today! Some fantastic presentations!
We are all really looking forward to tomorrow.
In terms of self reflection for this project if you could complete the same two questions as last time.

If you could also prepare a supporting document of all research conducted during this project. This could be an online or physical thing.

Questions:

1. What have you learnt during this project?

2. If you were given two more weeks to work on this project what would you do?

Your answers should be written as a group.
Please send this and any other links etc. to s.bannocks@gold.ac.uk
Submitted by the end of Friday.

Real best,

Stuart
Hello Y1

I have done my absolute best to incorporate all your requests. This is as accurate as possible to that. This is the final draft.

Three things:

1. Please let us know specifically where you would like us to meet you - some of you might have very particular routes, directions or performative elements that you wish to choreograph. Please email me this information today. Preferably in a google maps url.

2. Please email along with the above a contact phone number incase of delays etc. 

3. You are more than welcome to join us on our trip around stratford. It is always interesting and worthwhile to see your colleagues work.

We are all very much looking forward to seeing what you produce!

Real best,

Stuart
Hello Y1,

Just a quick reminder that there will be drop in tutorial sessions tomorrow in the studio with Liam & Patrick.

There is no fixed timetable for these. I would strongly recommend that you use these to refine and push your ideas/making this week.

Real best,

Stuart
We've talked about these guys in the past -- they're talking tomorrow night as part of the fine art lecture series:
Go, be critical and ask good questions!
Thank you for a great day of models and presentations. Some really excellent investigation and presentations. Very much looking forward to seeing what you do next!
Please make sure you are keeping your own record of your work. This will be essential for future ref etc. So take the time to photograph and document your models, components of work and process.
We are now working toward your interventions - please remember to really utilise all your group and start to prototype and test potential interventions etc. Get into the workshop - ask questions and start making!

Please bring all work to tutorials on Friday. Please see this as another opportunity to present all work and ideas so please prep accordingly (photos, films, objects models etc.)

Note: If you have a specific time or day specification for your presentation next week please let us know on Friday.

Have a good week!

Real best,

Stuart

It's been an intensive week, but make the most of reading week to reflect on all the sessions and to further research your topic. Think about how content from the sessions may support or develop your topic. 
I've heard lots of really interesting ideas and perspectives being discussed as topics which is great. Keep in mind that the word
so give yourselves some limits to what you want to discuss/convey in the zine. 
Please be aware that there will be separate register taken for this afternoon's Lecture. Those of you who already signed for the afternoon session this morning will not be counted. 
I have received notification that attendance at yesterday’s ecology and design lecture/series was poor.

It is essential that you attend all timetabled studies and that you are on time. Strolling in 10 minutes after the session has begun is unacceptable and disrespectful to your fellow students and to the staff running the session. 

For those of you who did miss this without notifying the design office with valid mitigating circumstances, or prior existing mitigation you will receive a warning letter.

Please attend all further sessions.
We will be enjoying breakfast from 10am, this will form the basis of the session so please bring something to eat, drink and share. It could be bread, jam, fruit, pancakes, teabags or anything else, either bought or made yourself.
 We will provide kettles, toasters, cups, plates, cutlery and even napkins.
Your intervention is routed in a series of parallel experiences, perspectives and layers of reference, as such it is incredibly complex and ultimately confusing (in a good way?). Much of this you are in total control of and you did extremely well in cajoling us into the designated roles you had assigned for us. This was really well crafted, from the lanyards to the specific instructions that you relayed in person in relative isolation on the short walk to the film location. As such when we came together to discuss our own experiences they were very different and hence the confusion and interest in that confusion arose. The parallel of the film set was as such really well placed, creating hierarchies of experiences and participation in the production. 
What this work produces as a whole is still somewhat a mystery to many of us, and the crafting of that story, of the rationale for our activities in that space needed some clarity in a way - the film becomes a rouse for the activity and the commotion created around this piece of architecture, its history, meaning and intention as a monument to canceled or failed futures. 
There is a question as to whether or not the film needs to be made, much like the office that disappears the day after the scam having seemingly being established and permanent, the dis-orienting effect of your film production creates an excitement that would have drawn attention to the object: what just happened here?! 
The particulates, the discrete objects here are fantastic in their own right, from the cake as a tribute or ritual eating of the space to the cape that extended the intended bridge off into the horizon. 
Your model presentation was excellent and you really managed to construct a visually as well as experientially interesting and engaging space. It worked extremely well as a vehicle to house and convey your observation in the space and the site for intervention. 
Ryan Gander’s retelling of Goldfinger’s Trellick tower from the perspective of a child is a nice one to look at 
In project 1.5, you are asked to consider your learning from the previous 4 projects and write your own project brief, allowing you to engage with a topic of your own interest. 
In project 1.1, +1 we visited the V&A collection in Kensington to research and respond to the collection. You were asked to select an existing grouping of objects and design into it. We asked you to design something that was appropriate and sensible to its context (the original collection) as well as being progressive and relevant to your own interests and interpretations - updating, growing, diversifying or subverting the collection. This was not simply an exercise in pure reproduction or copying, this was about designing an object that belongs within your understanding and de nition of a chosen collection - it was up to you having formulated this de nition to generate an informed and convincing rationale for what you added, what it does and why it belongs there. 
In project 1.2, Entangled Things you explored the complexities of things by looking at the worlds they/we inhabit and how new interpretations of these worlds in turn allow us to reinterpret and invent new things. You were also asked to work in groups to design maps and tools to understand an object and its entanglement with the world. You were then asked to design something that does one of the following: Transform, Extend, Uncover or Reinvent the original thing in response to your explorations. 
In project 1.3, For The Love Of we focused on human behavior. We concentrated on people’s loves and obsessions.The project focused on Research. We wanted youto continue to understand that research is not just collating and synthesizing information from the Internet and pasting it into a project (Secondary research). Research manifests itself in numerous forms and whenever possible, it is the creation of new knowledge. Research is not just gathered up, it is produced by asking appropriate and interesting questions to others, by experimenting with places, spaces and things, while also recording your observations and actions (Primary research). 
In project 1.4, The Environment Keeps Happening To Me you were asked to take an active role in a system and to either develop, appropriate or subvert it. You were asked to be -- “Architects of your sel sh and or social desire.” You were also asked to use the term ‘architecture’ as a vehicle to confront a range of contexts, schemes and scales of activity. 
2017 While the rst 3 projects allow a focus on a single user (you/other) or object, project 1.4 (a bridging project to year 2) asked you to consider a larger and possibly more complex reading of design where subjects, objects and spaces contribute to our understanding and development of culture. 
As with all of the projects the format is very simple. We have provided a template with 2 sections for you to complete, A Title and a Project Description. 
You must write a Project Title rather like an author writes a title for a book or an artist writes a title for a piece of their work. You will probably start by writing the project description/topic/context and once you have established this you will probably think of a title. 
You must write a short (Approximately 250 words) Project description that outlines the topic or context for the project. This might be something you have become interested in or something you have been waiting to work on for some time. It might be developed from an issue or observation noted down in one of your diaries/notebooks or from some research relating to some aspect of one of the previous projects. 
Throughout the year Studio Practice has been formatively assessed through a series of presentations and crits. The formative assessment has allowed you to re ect on your progress and make improvements as you go along. Your nal mark for this course will be awarded from the assessment of the nal project 1.5 where you will have the opportunity to respond to the formative feedback from throughout the year. 
The nal summative assessment will occur without you present. 
Title 
*********** 
Project Description (Approximately 250 Words) 
       *********************************
Duration 2017 
This project is launched during the nal week of term 2. You will be expected to work on this project over the Easter break. Students on other courses will be revising for exams in the summer term. You will have the advantage of being able to produce a body of work in your own time that will contribute to your nal mark. There will be 56 days (8 Weeks) from start to the nish for this project. We do expect you to have a short break but given the duration we will be expecting an improvement in the quality and quantity of the work. 
Presentation 
The project will be presented through exhibition only. All work produced should be displayed in your studio space at the submission deadline ** Friday 12th May 2017 at 4pm ** The presentation should be considered as a stand-alone presentation without any verbal explanation. In other words, not simply left on your desk but thoughtfully presented. 
Important: When designing your presentation, please refer to the BA Design marking criteria and ensure that you give a comprehensive, coherent account of your project. 
Please arrange any necessary equipment (computer, projector, TV etc.) in advance, and ensure that your presentation works smoothly. Anyone presenting using such equipment is advised to arrive early to set up, and return at 5.00pm to remove equipment. Or alternatively, discuss your presentation with tutors. 
Deliverables 
Your presentation should include. The Project Brief - Your typed project brief with your name and Project title. Your sketchbook - This should contain your research and design development for this project. This document should show research in the broadest terms, photography from di erent sources and including your own, referenced web images, observational drawings, theoretical papers/web links etc. etc. Sketches (that develop the research), design drawings and or sketches that develop your ideas towards the nal outcome. 
Your nal design, design intervention, Object, Image, Drawing, Film, etc. etc. including models, prototypes images, sketches etc. 
A 300-word (max) statement (not the brief) - This document should explain your project outcome and nal design and would also include your name and project title. 
2017 Self Evaluation 
Towards the project deadline you should complete a self-evaluation document, which is designed to help you re ect on your project work against the various marking criteria. The emphasis here is on a critical evaluation of your performance, to include perceived strengths and weaknesses in each category. Self-evaluation forms should be left in your space. Please leave the self- evaluation form with your work. Please note: this is an examination – there will be no extensions. 
Assessment and Feedback 
There are points within the project schedule at which information will be presented with verbal feedback, it is your responsibility to listen to the comments of sta (and students) and record them. Your overall project work will be assessed at the presentation exhibition. Following the exhibition you will receive an assessment document from the project sta . This document will indicate the level of your work against the marking criteria, and will give you an overall sense of your performance for this project. 
Assessment Evidence Base (marking criteria) All projects during Year 1 are marked using the following criteria, full details of which are available in the student handbook: Concept Formulation; Project Identi cation; Process; Research; Outcome; Presentation; Project Management (see Student Handbook or Self Evaluation form for details). 
Learning Outcomes 
At the end of this project students should demonstrate: 1. An awareness of their potential as a designer; beginning to understand and question how and why they wish to design; 2. The capacity to look at design and designing in relation to the imperatives of a user and to understand that what delineates design is use, in the broadest terms; 3. The development of practical skills and an awareness of various techniques and methods to model, represent and produce their ideas in 2D, 3D and text. Use e ectively and safely a range of tools and equipment; 4. An understanding of how design (object, image, text and system) signi es and carries values; 5. An awareness of theory, and an attempt to engage with its relevance to their practice, both as a starting point to design and as a discursive net to support and critique their designs 
********************************** Entangled Things ********************************** 
Introduction ********************************** Understanding the world of things is not a simple task, and as designers you will need to develop your skills of critically engaging and exploring the complex networks, relationships, practices, and actions that constitute things. We are deeply connected to the things that surround us, they augment our existence, and are integral to our everyday lives. It could be argued that we make things and in turn these things shape us. Our entanglement with things also extends to the living, we objectify animals giving them different names in the UK when they are alive and dead, as in pig and pork, and cow and beef, going back in history when meat was owned by the ruling french occupiers as tax. Christien Meindertsma has spent three years researching all the products made from a single pig in her book Pig 05049, which illustrates the extent of entanglement we have with them. The Anthropologist Tim Ingold talks about how objects are moments in the ow of material culture, where practices and imagination become manifest as things. This is an insightful reading of design as ux. They are collections of interconnected ows of changing matter, cultural practices converging as a singular thing, a thing that becomes an attractor or archetype. The analogy here is ‘words’ as objects in language, as words hold a collective meaning that changes over time. This brings into focus the parallel the connection between language and action with things and practices. If we think about things in these terms, then we have to address the object as an ongoing enacted performance between people and things. In this project we must consider how things allow us to act in the world, but they are often so deeply connected to us that they can go unnoticed. 
Interference ********************************** There is an interesting analysis of the interference of things on us, some things extend our interaction in the world, whilst others ef ciency reduce it. These have been described in terms of compression and donation by the architect Robin Evans in his book Translation from drawing to building. A compressive relationship is one that reduced our interaction with the world through ef ciency, like a washing machine or a GPS, but at the same time they diminishes our physical interactions with the world, as we don’t need to know the feeling of scrubbing clean fabric, or remembering our way through the city. On the other side is the donative object, one which extends and enriches our interactions with our physical experiences, like a musical instrument or a DSLR 
camera, as we have to develop a practice to become experts in their use. As the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus proposes that we can only truly understand a thing through the practice of using it ‘being in the world’, it discloses the world to us as we develop our skills to use it, and hence the the possibilities of our world change because we can use it. 
Being in the World ********************************** Skill in action-practice We are also interested in the connection between objects and mastery, look at the work of Hubert Dreyfus. Skillful enactment with things. As we have discussed that things also are the manifestation of cultural practices and actions. If we want to protest we could carry and broadcast the words of our protest with objects like placards or we could make yers, or perhaps even drop them from a ballon. The point we are making is to think about things differently. We need to unpack, discover, explore and play with these complex networks of entanglement. In this project we will be exploring the complexities of things by looking at the worlds we inhabit through the lens of the thing. This includes objects that mediate; identity, cultural practices, expertise, knowledge, power, connection, care, fear, and so on. We will fracture the chosen set of objects, and investigate them using a mapping tool that sets up an approach to questions the object in a number of ways.

2016 
Project Phases ********************************** 
Phase 1 Research Tuesday 15th NOV 10am - Friday 18th 
Starting in the studios for a brie ng on mapping your objects entanglement. Phase 1 will be done in groups of apx six. Each group will be given an object and will build a map of its entanglement. This map will be how your research is submitted Friday in the studio. 
You are required to produce a map of your research an study. This map could take many forms and can include a variety of mediums - it should be inclusive of all your studies. 
Phase 2 Designing Monday 21st NOV- Friday 2nd DEC 
You will now be using your entanglement maps to design individually. Not in groups! You will design 1 object each. This will be a new design of your object that considers the network of its entanglement. Re- address the object, think and develop how it could reveal, expose, extend, react, repurpose, transform, or question that network of entanglement through your design. 
Ideation performance workshop:

Phase3 Final Presentation 
Friday 2ND DEC In your Team you will now have 6 new designs ‘the Collection’ you have designed one thing each. We would like you to make a group presentation as a performance to show your network of your entangled thing, and the collection of things you have now individually made. It must be a single presentation not 6 seperate ones! 
Final Presentation ********************************** 
Friday 2ND DEC 2016 The work will be presented as a 10 minute performance. St James Stuido (Annexe) 
GROUPS A-B 10am - 1pm GROUPS C-D 2pm - 5pm 
Learning Outcomes ********************************** 
This project should enable students to: *Entangle theory and practice. *Examine further ways in which designs signify and carry values. *Explore appropriate and varied ways of looking and recording, manipulating materials and representing thoughts. *Extend existing skills and begin to develop new ones, utilizing techniques and processes being introduced through other aspects of the Programme. 
She said, ‘what is “historicity”?’ ‘When a thing has history in it. Listen. One of those two Zippo lighters was in Franklin D. Roosevelt’s pocket when he was assassinated. And one wasn’t. One has historicity, a hell of a lot of it. As much as any object ever had. And one has nothing .... You can’t tell which is which. ere’s no “mystical plasmic presence”, no “aura” around it.

In this brief you will annex a collection +1 
You will select an existing grouping of objects* and design into it. e object* you design should be appropriate and sensible to its context (the original collection) as well being progressive and relevant to your own interests 
and interpretations - updating, growing, diversifying or subverting the collection. 
*object here is used as shorthand for any number of artefacts in any number of mediums. 
Week 1 
PART 1: Research & Analysis 
Monday 17th: Brief launch - A Visit to the V&A Museum 
You will select and study a collection/ cabinet within the V&A Museum. is study will formulate the parameters for what you will design as an addition to your chosen collection. 
You will produce: notes, sketches, drawings and other documentation. You are asked in your study to consider and re ect upon: material, form, meaning, purpose, context, history, narrative etc. 
PLEASE NOTE: this is not an exercise in pure reproduction or copying, this is about designing an object that belongs within your understanding and de nition of a chosen collection - it is up to you having formulated this de nition to generate an informed and convincing rationale for what you will add, what it does and why it belongs.

THE
ENVIRONMENT
KEEPS
HAPPENING
TO
ME
“In this moment, a now of ever growing ‘corporate
personhood’, where nations, cities, demographics,
organisations, collectives, businesses, websites,
services, shops, homes, and objects are
cut ‘n’ paste, finely sliced legal landscapes,
the ability to confidently discern between the
public and private realm becomes illusive.
Every day we traverse a patch-worked collage,
a bric-a-brac of situations unique in their
uniformity. Situations defined by systems,
unspoken contracts,‘safe-walks’, expectations,
responsibilities and limitations. We are funnelled
into lanes, alleys, actions, roles and thoughts.
The environment keeps happening to you.
The environment keeps happening to me.”
-- JL & SB
In this brief you will take an active role in
a system.
The system you address might be something you
develop, appropriate or subvert.
You will be -- “Architects of your selfish and or
social desire.”
Throughout this project we will use the term
‘architecture’ as a vehicle to confront a range of
contexts, schemes and scales of activity.
This project is broken into two stages and you will
directly address two different scales which relate
to two discrete deliverables:
Stage 1 – 1:25 ❏ (Re)search, model & proposal. 
Stage 2 – 1:1 ❏ Intervention. 
Stage 1: (Re)search & model
Your group will be given a specific location in
which to begin your study. Within that location
you are asked to observe and analyse: individuals,
‘THE OTHER’, crowds, groups, systems, behaviours,
privacy, exposure, politics, actions, movements,
modes, limits, paths, components, rules,
guides, directions, designs, demands, requests,
orientation, disorientation . . . and so on and on.
Consider the potential methods by which you can
conduct a study of your location.
Be experimental. Be critical.
NOTE:
Conduct yourself considerately in relation to the
general public and others around you.
Be aware and adhere to legalities. STAY SAFE!
DELIVERABLE 1
You have been given an architectural figure:
it is 1:25.
❏ Build a 1:25 model of the *behaviour* that you have observed and wish to address. This model will support an architectural narrative that you will present as a group. 
This narrative might well utilise other supporting
forms of research material, such as sketches,
other models, images, film etc. but the model is
the primary vehicle for delivering any
research findings.
The model might be literal containing accurate
topological data (buildings, street furniture,
found objects etc.) or it might be an abstraction,
or a combination of the two.
The model is to be understood as two things:
❏A summation and presentation of researched information. 
❏A proposal for an intervention, outlining your intentions. 
Stage 2: Architectural Intervention
Design and contrive your proposed intervention.
YOU ARE ASKED TO CONSIDER AND FRAME YOUR
INTERVENTION WITHIN THESE PARAMETERS:
Notes on our feedback tutorial: 
Be wary of the contextless comment. Finding where your objects live becomes really important in terms of pushing your practice further - it's a case of elevating the outcome but also considering the context in the development of the work. 
These critical or comment oriented objects can have a lot of merit but they need to be pinned down to the same rigour as other design objects - a use, an audience etc. 
You have a series of strong 'outcomes' or directions within this project and they work together to build an essay of engagement with the topic of apologies. As we deal with increasingly more complex topics within our projects the idea of a single outcome can become redundant. Embrace this. Ask what unifies the things you have created etc. The Jersey cabbage bread is a lovely vehicle for your inheritance ritual and it subtly references the original collection in a way that isn’t too obvious (I’m happy the ‘born with a silver spoon’ reference isn’t front and centre). 
The justification text is very balanced in terms of its reference to both the Jersey tax haven (it’s not too descriptive) and your objects narrative. 
The project was managed very well as you didn’t spend too much time casting or making the object, which meant you were able to craft and refine the narrative. 
Your process has been founded on drawing and making (paper prototypes, models etc.) and this is reflected in an outcome that is considered in both its concept and materiality - this was a result of an iterative process that involved you designing, iterating, reflecting. Keep this up! Remember in future projects to always be rigorous in your research of a chosen context, as it will present opportunities for design - such as the jersey cabbage bread, david cameron’s tax haven building etc. 
This is the beginning of great project. Photograph it properly. Maybe make a film of the process? This object was generated through deriving an artefact from a context (jersey bread), designing an object in response to it (your object), and the next step you need to think about is how you would re-contextualise this object i.e consider where this cabbage leaf would go when it’s not involved in the bread making process - is it on the wall, above the fireplace, who’s fireplace? 
Great work - keep going, keep making & keep producing!

to be designed, for you to design!
The object you made needs a higher resolution – if it’s an archive, it needs to be an archive – how are
photographs preserved? How are paints kept, etc etc. There is a lots of detail here that you could get into a
develop. What are the material processes you can develop here that are specific to the project? How do
you handle the archiving of materials /// The geology of ford-ite /// Memorial /// Birthplace of cultural byproducts.

As a group your research was excellent, and put you all in a good position to develop the project.
Your presentation was good in some ways but left me very confused. It was never really explained or made
obvious otherwise what the oil bottle was supposed to be doing? Your explanation of creating a byproduct
could have been really significant but it was lost on us. Throughout the presentation you almost
performed as a group, but it never really managed to get past students showing student work. I think some
more prep and communication between you all was needed here.

The concept and project identification are spelled out very well in your 100 word statement. The tie is such a
ubiquitous garment, and is able to carry many meanings and codes within it. Your process and research was great, and
I loved your experiments with different ties.
Identifying particular people to base the ties on is good, and gives you something specific to work around. These
people, heroes or villains, give us an example of practices or behaviours that have become emblematic of financial
culture today. The statements are important so I wonder if (as they come from you) you are in danger of making
assumptions about what they may think, and rather, it may be more compelling to work with real “quotes”, statements
or messages from bankers themselves, and that may add an extra depth and authenticity to the project. More research,
such as interviews with these subjects, may have given you real understanding of their experience.
The collection is well displayed, on the velvet cushion which is emblematic of a luxury Saville row shirtmakers, and
it’s great to see you’ve used the workshop.
I’d encourage you to take this project further by designing a complete tie – pattern included, and see if you can produce
this via the embroidery machine. The ties look like they could go two directions. First they could become a means of
protest, that inspire connections between like minded people through words or codes or symbols. Or they could tell a
story, moral tale of the legends of the industry – successful or tragic. In either case it would be interesting to construct
your own pattern, complete with icons, colours and text, thereby designing your own rich symbolic narrative language.

Making is at the heart of what we do - we make ideas, concepts, prototypes, services, experiences, objects, communities - and, in this, we aim to better the world.  We are speculative and realistic in our approach; we teach you to imagine futures and fictionalise the world to speculate on the 'what if...' And we negotiate with the realities of our past and contemporary existence to intervene in the here and now.The BA Design is a practice-led programme that both integrates and challenges specialisms and their boundaries.
